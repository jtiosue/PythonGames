# PyCodenamesDuet

FOR MAC, you need to change "bg=color" to "highlightbackground=color, highlightthickness=5" in the ui file. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1529847/how-to-change-the-foreground-or-background-colour-of-a-tkinter-button-on-mac-os. 

Implements the Codenames Duet game over a server. It works if you run the server and two player scripts on the same local network.

I got the wordlist from here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1383878/word-list-future-moderators-codenames-games.
