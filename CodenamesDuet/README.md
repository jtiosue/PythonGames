# PyCodenamesDuet

FOR MAC, you need to change "bg=color" to "highlightbackground=color, highlightthickness=5" in the ui file. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1529847/how-to-change-the-foreground-or-background-colour-of-a-tkinter-button-on-mac-os. 

Implements the Codenames Duet game over a server (I don't know why but my server is not working. If anyone can fix it, please do and let me know how you did it!)

It works if you run the server and two player scripts on the same local machine.
